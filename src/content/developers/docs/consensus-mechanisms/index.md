When it comes to blockchains like Ethereum, which are in essence distributed databases, the nodes of the network must be able to reach agreement on the current state of the system. This is achieved using consensus mechanisms.

Although not a part of building a dapp, understanding consensus mechanisms will help explain things that are relevant to you and your users' experience, like gas prices and transaction times.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To better understand this page, we recommend you first read our [introduction to Ethereum](/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/).

## What is a consensus mechanism? {#what-is-a-consensus-mechanism}

Consensus mechanisms (also known as consensus protocols or consensus algorithms) allow distributed systems (networks of computers) to work together and stay secure.

For decades, these mechanisms have been used to establish consensus among database nodes, application servers, and other enterprise infrastructure. In recent years, new consensus protocols have been invented to allow cryptoeconomic systems, such as Ethereum, to agree on the state of the network.

A consensus mechanism in a cryptoeconomic system also helps prevent certain kinds of economic attacks. In theory, an attacker can compromise consensus by controlling 51% of the network. Consensus mechanisms are designed to make this "51% attack" unfeasible. Different mechanisms are engineered to solve this security problem differently.

<!-- ### Consensus -->

<!-- Formal requirements for a consensus protocol may include: -->

<!-- - Agreement: All correct processes must agree on the same value. -->
<!-- - Weak validity: For each correct process, its output must be the input of some correct process. -->
<!-- - Strong validity: If all correct processes receive the same input value, then they must all output that value. -->
<!-- - Termination: All processes must eventually decide on an output value -->

<!-- ### Fault tolerance -->
<!-- TODO explain how protocols must be fault tolerant -->

### Proof of work {#proof-of-work}

Ethereum, like Bitcoin, currently uses a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol.

#### Block creation {#pow-block-creation}

Proof-of-work is done by [miners](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/mining/), who compete to create new blocks full of processed transactions. The winner shares the new block with the rest of the network and earns some freshly minted ETH. The race is won by whoever's computer can solve a math puzzle fastest â€“ this produces the cryptographic link between the current block and the block that went before. Solving this puzzle is the work in "proof of work".

#### Security {#pow-security}

The network is kept secure by the fact that you'd need 51% of the network's computing power to defraud the chain. This would require such huge investments in equipment and energy, you're likely to spend more than you'd gain.

### Proof of stake {#proof-of-stake}

Ethereum has plans to upgrade to a [proof-of-stake (PoS)](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) consensus protocol.

#### Block creation {#pos-block-creation}

Proof-of-stake is done by validators who have staked ETH to participate in the system. A validator is chosen at random to create new blocks, share them with the network and earn rewards. Instead of needing to do intense computational work, you simply need to have staked your ETH in the network. This is what incentivises healthy network behaviour.

#### Security {#pos-security}

A proof-of-stake system is kept secure by the fact that you'd need 51% of the total staked ETH to defraud the chain. And that your stake is slashed for malicious behaviour.
