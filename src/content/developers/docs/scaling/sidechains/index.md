A sidechain is a separate blockchain which runs in parallel to Ethereum mainnet and operates independently. It has its own [consensus algorithm](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/) (e.g. [Proof of Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_authority), [Delegated proof-of-stake](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS), [Byzantine fault tolerance](https://decrypt.co/resources/byzantine-fault-tolerance-what-is-it-explained)). It is connected to mainnet by a two-way bridge.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You should have a good understanding of all the foundational topics and a high-level understanding of [Ethereum scaling](/developers/docs/scaling/).

## Pros and cons {#pros-and-cons}

| Pros                                             | Cons                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Established technology.                          | Less decentralized.                                                                            |
| Supports general computation, EVM compatibility. | Uses a separate consensus mechanism. Not secured by layer 1 (so technically itâ€™s not layer 2). |
|                                                  | A quorum of sidechain validators can commit fraud.                                             |

### Use Sidechains {#use-sidechains}

Multiple projects provide implementations of sidechains that you can integrate into your dapps:

- [Skale](https://skale.network/)
- [POA Network](https://www.poa.network/)
- [xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com/)
