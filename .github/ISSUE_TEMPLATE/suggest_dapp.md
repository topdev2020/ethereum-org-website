Before suggesting a dapp, make sure you've read [our listing policy](https://www.ethereum.org/en/contributing/adding-products/).

Only continue with the issue if your dapp meets the criteria listed there.

If it does complete the following information which we need to accurately list the wallet.

<!-- Can community developers open PRs against the repo? Is your smart contract available for other developers to use? -->

**Can a user access the dapp without creating an account?**

<!-- Can a user simply connect with their Ethereum address? If not, explain the process. -->

**Are dapp funds non-custodial?**

<!-- If your product frontend disappears, can users can still access and move their funds. -->

<!-- Please let us know about any Discord servers or other means of providing support to users. -->
